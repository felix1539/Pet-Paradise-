# Pet-Paradise-
This is my Database project using basic SQL commands and mysql local server

I conceptualized and developed a comprehensive pet paradise database utilizing SQL for data management and MySQL as the local server. 
This project demonstrates my expertise in database design and management. 
By employing SQL queries and structuring the database schema, I created an efficient system to store and retrieve pet-related information. 
The project includes features such as pet profiles, medical records, and adoption status, emphasizing my attention to detail and organizational skills. 
Implementing MySQL as the local server ensured seamless data integration and retrieval. This hands-on experience not only underscores my proficiency in SQL and database management but also showcases my dedication to creating practical, real-world solutions.
